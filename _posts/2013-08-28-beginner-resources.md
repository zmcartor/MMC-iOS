### NSScreencasts
Small videos (about 10mins each) covering a specific topic in Cocoa or
Objective-C. The first video, [Objective-C basics](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/1-objective-c-basics) is highly recommened.

### CocoaDevCentral Learn Objective-C
Thorough and concise descripton of everything in the Objective-C language. This
is a great resource to keep handy while going through the first couple
tutorials. [Learn Objective-C](http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/)

### Official Apple Documentation
If you really want to get deep, Apple documentation is always the most
inclusive and authoritative. [Objective-C Primer](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/Learning_Objective-C_A_Primer/)
